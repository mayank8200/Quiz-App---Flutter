In this app we are going to have the features or modules mentioned below:<br>

* Three multiple-choice questions ( more questions can be added ).
* Four selectable options for each question in the form of buttons.
* The score will be calculated based on the option selected for each question (Internally).
* The final score will be shown at the end of the quiz in addition to the reset button.
* There are two screens in the app home ( were questions will be shown) and result screen ( where score will be shown).
* The whole app will be separated into five different modules namely main.dart, question.dart, answer.dart,quiz.dart and reslut.dart.

Making this app will give you a good revision of flutter and dart basics. As we are covering a lot of concepts such as:

* Showing Widgets on the screen.
* Recycling Widgets.
* Changing Screens.
* Internal Logic
* and else.
